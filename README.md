The Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch

This is a project for the Odin Project. Requirements for this project can be found at http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery

The purpose of the site is to have a drawing Sketchpad like an Etch-A-Sketch that can be sized on user input from the initial pageload.
